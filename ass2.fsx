//Checklist for Programming with Recursion
//Basis Case must return the correct result: True, if the list is empty then we return an empty list (which is sorted)
//         If the cardinality of the list == 1 then we return the list b.c a list of size one is already sorted.
//Non-basis case must do so too, assuming Rec. hypothesis: False, the non-basis case does not return the correct result, but returns a slightly varied version  of the list
//         We have to keep swapping elemets until we can parse through all elements without having to swap once.
// Recursion must be on a "smaller" input: True, each time we make the recursice call we are doing a list one element smaller then the prev list.
